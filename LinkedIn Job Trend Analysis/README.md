Load data
Read the CSV into a Pandas DataFrame and quickly inspect df.head() and df.columns to understand available fields and formats. Ensure encoding and delimiter are correct to avoid mis-parsed columns.

Explore structure & quality
Check data types, missing values, and duplicates (df.info(), df.isnull().sum(), df.duplicated()); this tells you what cleaning is required and where information is sparse. Note columns that map to job title, skills, and location.

Standardize & rename columns
Rename inconsistent column names (e.g., Job_Title → Job Title) and standardize casing/whitespace so subsequent code uses consistent labels. This prevents KeyErrors and simplifies analysis.

Clean rows and values
Drop exact-duplicate rows and remove or impute rows missing critical fields (job title, skills, city). Also trim whitespace and normalize text (lowercase or titlecase as needed) for consistent grouping.

Parse skills into lists
Split the skills string into a list for each row (e.g., by commas or semicolons), strip extra spaces, and optionally normalize synonyms (e.g., “nlp” → “NLP”). This converts free-text skill tags into analyzable tokens.

Token normalization & deduplication
Lowercase or titleize skills, map common variants to a canonical term (create a small lookup), and deduplicate per row so counts accurately reflect demand. This reduces fragmentation in counts.

Aggregate skill frequencies
Explode the skills column and count occurrences to get overall skill popularity and top-N lists. These counts form the foundation for trend visuals and recommendations.

City-wise and role-wise aggregation
Group exploded skills by Location and Job Title to compute counts per city and per role; pivot these into matrices for heatmaps and comparison. This reveals geographic and role-specific demand patterns.

Visualize findings
Create bar charts for top skills, heatmaps for top skills by city, and a skill-vs-role matrix to illustrate relationships. Use clear labels, consistent color maps, and limit to top-N entries to keep visuals readable.

Derive insights & recommendations
Interpret the top skills and their city/role concentrations to produce actionable recommendations (e.g., which skills to learn for a city or role). Prioritize high-frequency, growing, or cross-role skills.

Export results & deliverables
Save summarized tables and figures to Excel or image files for sharing; include the pivot tables and top-N CSVs for reproducibility. Provide a short written summary highlighting 3–5 key takeaways.

Next steps & validation
If possible, compare with external sources or recent postings to validate trends, monitor changes over time, or extend analysis to time-series if your dataset has dates. Automate the pipeline for periodic re-run when new data arrives.
